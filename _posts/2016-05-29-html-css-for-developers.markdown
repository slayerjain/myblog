It's finally the day I took HTML/CSS or rather Web Designing more seriously. I've always been hesitant about writing HTML code from the time i was introduced to it in 8th Grade. Maybe because everything felt so static those days and all my friends were doing it. I decided to spend most of my time with system programming and mathematics, and Oh boy, i did really enjoy it! I've got around writing HTML code by using various templates and frameworks, but an urge to learn 'HTML the hardway' was building up inside of me. Now I have my Web Designing Exam tomorrow, and i think it's now or never!

so here's the starting HTML code provided by Atom text editor:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
