Heya!

My name is Shubham Jain, I'm a third year Computer Science Engineering student at BVCOE, New Delhi. I am a programmer, Music Producer and an aspiring enterprenuer. As far music production is concerned, I am a vocalist (clean, screech, growls..), lyricist, guitarist and can play any standard stringed instrument by intuition and a little practice. 

I've started blogging again for good! Having been recently introduced to the Open Source world,
I'm really enjoying contributing to some really exciting projects, but I think documenting my experience could be an even greater contribution for desperate coders like me.
