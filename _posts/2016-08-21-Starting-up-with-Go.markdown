I am a simple man, I just wanted to build a scalable API for my mobile App project, that's when I ran into a series of hairy errors with my `MEAN` stack project. I tried debugging it manually and also via some debugging tools, but nothing really worked. Someone suggested me to try `Postgres` with my server, pointing out instability issues with `mongoose` (a mongo adapter for node.js). That's when someone else suggested me to try `Go`, a language he used for his API, and which had just 40 pages of official docs!

As expected, I downloaded the Go complier, and headed to the startup guide, which had video of how to organize Go `source code` and `binaries`. After that i headed to the Go Tour, which has been really interesting so far! I'm on the last module apparently.
