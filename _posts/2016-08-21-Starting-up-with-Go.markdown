I am a simple man, i just wanted to build a scalable API for my mobile App project, that's when I ran into a serious error with my 'MEAN' stack project. i tried debugging it manually and also by debugging tools, but nothing really worked. That's when someone suggested me to try go, a language he used for his API, and which had just 40 pages of official docs!

You know what happened! I downloaded the Go complier, and headed to the startup guide, which had video of how to organize Go 'source code' and 'binaries'. After that i headed to the Go Tour, which has been really interesting so far! I'm on the last module apparently.
